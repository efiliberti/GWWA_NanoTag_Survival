Script used to run return rate analyses (GLMM) and apparent annual survival models (NIMBLE) for marked Golden-winged Warblers from 2021-2024. This was a range-wide initiative that consisted of VHF-tagging individuals, particularly females, to boost annual detection probabilities in subsequent years. We specifically targeted females to balance sex-ratios between males and females and reduce potential biases in population survival estimates.
